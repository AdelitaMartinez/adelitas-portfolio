            <h3>Name: Josh Smith </h3>
               <h3>Profession:</h3>
                    <p>Josh is a recruiting coordinator to a small local tech company looking for potential
                    candidates to fill an entry-level position. They are looking for both front end and back
                    end candidates.</p>
               <h3>Technology:</h3>
                    <p>Uses Mac at work and at home. His preferred browser is chrome. He owns an Iphone 14
                    which he uses for work as well. </p>
                <h3>Frustrations and Needs:</h3>
                    <p>Josh must look at multiple resumes and potential candidates
                     in a short amount of time. He feels like the resumes he's getting
                     are all very similar looking, so he prefers looking at candidates previous work
                     and personal portfolios. He needs to find candidates who have a good
                        personality and is able to work well as part of a team. Josh does not
                    want to have to hunt for skill sets or contact information on a portfolio. He needs to be able to
                    find the information he is looking for easily so that he does not waste time.</p>
                  <h3>Goals:</h3>
                    <p>His only goal is to find a candidates who not only has the technical abilities he is looking for, but
                        also will mesh well with current staff. He would like to see unique portfolios that show both
                        personality and skill. He needs to be able to skim at a portfolio for a few minutes and
                        decide if they are a potential candidate or not.
                      He must also be able to find contact information and links to other socials easily.</p>
        <h3>User Story:</h3> <p>As a user, I need to quickly figure out if this person is right for this
         position. </p>
