               <h3>Profession:</h3>
                    <p>Josh is a recruiting coordinator to a small local tech company looking for potential
                    candidates to fill an entry-level position. They are looking for both front end and back

                <h3>Frustrations and Needs:</h3>
                    <p>Josh must look at multiple resumes and potential candidates
                     in a very short amount of time. He feels like the resumes he's getting
                     are all very similar looking, so he prefers looking at previous work
                     and personal portfolios. He needs to find candidates who have a good personality and is able to work
                     well as part of a small team.</p>

                        like to see unique portfolios that show both personality and skill. He needs to be able to look at a
                      portfolio for a few minutes and decide if they are a potential candidate or not.
                      He must also be able to find contact information and links to other socials easily and quickly.</p>
        <h3>User Story:<h3></h3> <p>As a user, I need to quickly figure out if this person is right for this entry-level
         position. </p>
