    <h3>Welcome/About Me :</h3>
        <p>This will be a very brief and casual introduction where I will introduce myself and my skill set (Full Stack).
        This message will be shown over a large image. Links to my LinkedIn and GitHub
        can be seen on the upper right side for easy access.</p>

    <h3>Skill Sets:</h3>
    <p>This section will showcase programming languages and skills for both front end and back end development.
    Icons will be used with programming language/skill title to make it easily readable and more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

    <h3>Projects:</h3>
    <p>This section will be used to showcase past projects (capstone), and any future projects that may be produced. There will be a photo and description
        on the project and my specific role. Links to live page and project code on GitHub will be listed here as well. </p>

    <h3>Contact Form:</h3>
    <p>This section will contain a basic contact form where potential employers
        and collaborators can reach out. </p>

    <h3>Footer</h3>
    <p>This will be a basic footer that will also contain small icon links my GitHub and LinkedIn. This will be for those who
    do not want to use the contact form, but are short on time and do not want to scroll back up to find this information.</p>


    <h3>Wireframes:</h3>
    <p>There will be one basic layout that will be responsive to both mobile and
    desktop. These wireframes were made with <a href="https://balsamiq.com">https://balsamiq.com</a></p>
